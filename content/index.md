At **CoCreations**, we transform ideas into tangible experiences that resonate within the public realm. Our work bridges the gap between art and community, creating sculptures that engage, inspire, and endure. Led by Natalie and supported by a talented team of artists and designers, we specialize in public sculpture and 3D modeling, turning visions into iconic landmarks.

#### Public Sculpture

Our public sculptures are more than just installations; they are expressions of culture, history, and the human experience. We collaborate closely with communities, architects, and planners to design and fabricate works that not only enhance public spaces but also tell stories that resonate with all who encounter them.

Each piece is crafted with precision and care, from concept to final installation, ensuring that it not only stands as a testament to artistic innovation but also as a lasting contribution to the public landscape.

#### 3D Modeling

Innovation meets artistry in our 3D modeling studio, where imagination takes form in stunning detail. Whether we’re developing concepts for large-scale sculptures or creating intricate designs for digital media, our 3D modeling capabilities allow us to explore and realize the full potential of each project.

Our team utilizes the latest technology and software to create models that are both visually striking and technically sound, ensuring that every detail is executed to perfection. From initial sketches to final renderings, we bring your creative vision to life in ways that are both dynamic and impactful.

#### Our Mission

At CoCreations, our mission is to create art that connects people with the spaces they inhabit.
